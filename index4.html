        <h3>All information about Berlin</h3>
        <p>Berlin [ bɛr'li:n ] is the capital [11] and a state of the Federal Republic of Germany [12] [13] . With
            around 3.8 million inhabitants, the city is the most populous and, at 892 square kilometers, the largest
            municipality in Germany and the most populous city in the European Union . [4] With 4210 inhabitants per
            square kilometer, the city has the third highest population density in Germany. In the Berlin
            agglomerationPlay audio fileAlmost 4.7 million people live in Berlin, and around 6.2 million live in the
            Berlin-Brandenburg capital region . The city-state consists of twelve districts . In addition to the rivers
            Spree , Havel and Dahme, there are smaller watercourses in the city area as well as numerous lakes and
            forests. The neighboring towns of Alt-Kölln and Alt-Berlin were first mentioned in documents in 1237 and
            1244 in what is now the district of Mitte . The double city was founded as a trading center and rose to
            become an important economic center in the Middle Ages . In its almost 800-year historyBerlin was the
            capital of Mark Brandenburg , Prussia and Germany . In the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, Berlin
            consolidated itself as an international city with a lot of people moving in to the world's fourth largest
            city, with Berlin's classics as a cultural location, as the center of the European Enlightenment , and as an
            important industrial and scientific location. After the end of World War II, the city was subject to
            four-power status in 1945 ; From 1949 East Berlin served as the capital of the socialist autocracy of the
            German Democratic Republic, while West Berlin was closely attached to the free-democratic Federal Republic .
            With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification in 1990, the two halves of the city grew
            together again and Berlin regained its role as the all-German capital. Since 1999 the city has been the seat
            of the Federal Government , the Federal President , the German Bundestag , the Bundesrat and most of the
            federal ministries , numerous federal authorities and embassies .

            The most important branches of Berlin's economy include tourism , the creative and cultural industries ,
            biotechnology and healthcare with medical technology and the pharmaceutical industry , information and
            communication technology , the construction and real estate industries , trade , optoelectronics , energy
            technology and trade fairs and congresses . The city is a European transport hubRoad , rail and air
            transport . Berlin is one of the up-and-coming, international centers for innovative company founders and
            start-up companies . Berlin records high annual growth rates in the number of people in work . [14]

            Berlin is considered a cosmopolitan city of culture , politics , media and science . [15] [16] [17] [18] The
            local universities and research institutes , local sports and museums enjoy an international reputation.
            [19] The metropolis has the UNESCO title City of Design and is one of the most visited centers on the
            continent. [20] Architecture , festivities and nightlifeare known worldwide. [21]

            Location of Berlin in Germany and the European Union
            Berlin's prominent reference point, the Red Town Hall , is geographically located at 52° 31' 7″ north
            latitude, 13° 24' 30″ east longitude, the city's centroid is about two kilometers south of it in Kreuzberg (
            ♁ 52° 30' 10 .4″ N , 13°24′15.1″ E ). The greatest expansion of the urban area in the east-west direction is
            around 45 kilometers, in the north-south direction around 38 kilometers. The area of ​​Berlin is almost 892
            km². The city is located in the northeast of the Federal Republic of Germany and is completely surrounded by
            the state of Brandenburg .

            The historic center is located at the narrowest and thus most accessible point of the Warsaw-Berlin glacial
            valley , which crosses Berlin from the south-east to the north-west and is traversed by the Spree in an
            east-west direction. The north-eastern part of Berlin lies on the Barnim plateau , almost half of the city
            area in the south-west lies on the Teltow plateau . The westernmost district, Spandau , is divided into the
            Berlin glacial valley, the Brandenburg-Potsdam Havelgebiet and the Zehdenick-Spandau Havelniederung . The
            landscape of Berlin was created in the Ice Ageduring the most recent glacial phase, the Weichselian Ice Age
            . About 20,000 years ago, the Berlin area was covered by the several hundred meter thick Scandinavian ice
            sheet ( glacier ). When the glacier melted back about 18,000 years ago, the Berlin glacial valley was
            formed.

            left area is Potsdamer Platz, in the middle of the photo is the TV tower and in the distance are the first
            fields and forests.
            Expansion of urban space from the center to the north
            Berlin has numerous rivers and lakes. The Spree flows into the Havel in Spandau , which flows through
            western Berlin in a north-south direction. Berlin tributaries of the Spree are the Panke , the Dahme , the
            Wuhle and the Erpe . The course of the Havel, actually a glacial channel , often resembles a lake landscape;
            the largest bulges are the Tegeler See and the Große Wannsee . The brooks Tegeler Fliess and Bäke , which
            flow into the Havel, are partly in Berlin . The largest lake in Berlin is the Great
            MüggelseeTreptow-Koepenick district .

            In Berlin, 13 water protection areas covering an area of ​​around 212 km² have been designated by water
            protection area ordinances. In relation to the total city area of ​​around 890 km², around a quarter of the
            city area is designated as water protection areas. [22]

            The highest elevations in Berlin are the Große Müggelberg ( 115 m above sea level) in the Treptow-Köpenick
            district as the highest natural elevation , and the Arkenberge ( 122 m above sea level ) in the Pankow
            district , which were created from construction waste and which was heaped up from the rubble of the Second
            World War Teufelsberg ( 120 m above sea level ) in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district and the
            Ahrensfeld mountains ( 114 m above sea level ) in the Wuhletal landscape park in the Marzahn-Hellersdorf
            district. The lowest point in Berlin is ( 28.1 m above sea level ) on the Spektesee in the Spandau district.

            lower part of the picture are houses.
            The Big Zoo (2006)
            In addition to extensive forest areas in the west and south-east of the city ( Berlin Forests ) , Berlin has
            many large parks. Since almost all streets are lined with trees, Berlin is considered a particularly green
            city. There are around 440,000 street trees in total in Berlin, including 153,000 linden trees , 82,000
            maple trees , 35,000 oaks , 25,000 plane trees and 21,000 chestnuts . [24] The more than 2,500 public green,
            recreational and park areas have a total area of ​​over 5,500 hectares and offer a wide range of leisure and
            recreational opportunities. This is the largest facility in Berlin that is used as a park todayTempelhofer
            Feld , which arose from the former Tempelhof Airport .

            In the center of the city is the Great Tiergarten . It is the oldest and, at 210 hectares, the second
            largest and most important park in Berlin and was designed over the course of more than 500 years.
            Originally an extensive forest area outside the city gates, used by the Prussian nobles as a hunting and
            riding area, this was gradually surrounded by urban development. Today it stretches from the Zoo train
            station to the Brandenburg Gate and borders directly on the government district . Several major roads
            intersect the Tiergarten, including Straße des 17. Juni as an east-west axis. They cross at the Großer Stern
            , in the middle of which has been the Victory Column since 1939stands. The Großer Tiergarten has the shape
            of a semi-natural park landscape : Characteristic are the wide lawns, criss-crossed by small watercourses
            and planted with groups of trees, as well as the lakes with small islands and numerous bridges and avenues.
            Plants such as the English Garden , the Luiseninsel and the rose garden set ornamental accents in some
            places.

            Alongside the Tiergarten, Treptower Park in south-east Berlin is one of the city's most important parks. It
            was created from 1876 to 1882 by Gustav Meyer , the first director of horticulture in Berlin. The wide
            garden landscape that stretches along the Spree is one of the most popular destinations for Berliners, not
            least because of today's Zenner restaurant, which was built in 1821/1822 by Carl Ferdinand Langhans as an
            inn on the Spree .

            consists of many low bushes and some white flowering shrubs. The fence consists of about eleven rows of
            letters and is surmounted by a large hedge in the background.
            gardens of the World
            A distinctive feature among the parks is the Botanical Garden . Located in the southwest of the city, it is
            used not only for academic purposes (it belongs to the Freie Universität Berlin ) but also as a recreation
            park. The previous facility had existed since 1697 on the site of today's Kleist Park in Schöneberg . From
            1897 the construction of the new park in Dahlem and Groß-Lichterfelde took place . [25] After the Greater
            Berlin Law of 1920 and the local government reform of 1938, the Botanical Garden is now in the district of
            Lichterfelde. With an area of ​​over 43 hectares, it is the fourth largest botanical garden in the world. It
            includes around 22,000 different plant species. The 25 meter high, 30 meter wide and 60 meter long Great
            Tropical House is the tallest greenhouse in the world.

            Other parks in Berlin are the palace gardens in Charlottenburg , Glienicke and on the Pfaueninsel (the last
            two are UNESCO World Heritage sites ), the historic parks Lustgarten , Viktoriapark , Rudolph-Wilde-Park and
            Schillerpark and the numerous large public gardens . The Federal Garden Show took place in the Britzer
            Garden in 1985, and the Berlin Garden Show in 1987 in what is now the Gardens of the World . In 2017 the
            International Garden Exhibition took place there. TheMauerpark on the former death strip of the Berlin Wall
            , the Schöneberger Südgelände nature reserve , Görlitzer Park and Spreebogenpark are among the younger parks
            in Berlin.

            Tiger in Tierpark Berlin ( Friedrichsfelde district )

            Zoological garden in the Tiergarten district , zoo with the most species in the world and the only zoo in
            Germany with panda bears
            Berlin has several zoological facilities : the Zoological Garden with Aquarium and the Tierpark . The
            Zoological Garden, which opened in 1844 on what was then the city limits of Charlottenburg , is the oldest
            zoo in Germany and also the most species-rich in the world (around 15,000 animals of 1,500 species). The
            much younger zoo owes its existence to the division of Germany after 1945: Because the Zoological Garden was
            in the British sector of the city, the capital of the GDR did not have its own zoological facility. 1954
            were therefore in Friedrichsfelde under the direction of Heinrich DatheAn animal park was opened on the
            grounds of the Friedrichsfelde Palace Park . At 160 hectares, it is the largest landscape animal park in
            Europe.

            In Berlin there are 43 nature reserves (as of 2018) with a total area of ​​2668 hectares, which corresponds
            to around 3.0% of the state area. [26] In addition, there are 56 landscape protection areas , which take up
            a further 14% of the country's area. [27] In addition, the districts of Pankow and Reinickendorf have an
            area share of 5.4% in the transnational, 75,000 hectare Barnim Nature Park . [28]

            climate
            The city is located in the temperate climate zone at the transition from maritime to continental climate.
            Since the beginning of the 20th century, mean annual temperatures have fluctuated between 7 °C and 11 °C,
            and the trend is rising. [29] [30] The average annual temperature in Berlin-Dahlem is 9.5 °C and the average
            annual precipitation is 591 mm. The warmest months are July and August with an average of 19.1 and 18.2 °C
            respectively, the coldest January with an average of 0.6 °C. The previous maximum temperature in Berlin of
            38.9 °C was measured on August 7, 2015 at the Kaniswall station. [31] Most precipitationfalls in August with
            an average of 64 mm, the lowest in April with an average of 33 mm (all mean values ​​from 1981 to 2010 from
            the German Weather Service ). [32]

            With regard to wind speeds and wind direction distribution, a two-part maximum is recorded. Accordingly,
            north-west and south-west winds are observed most frequently in Berlin, which are associated with higher
            speeds, especially in winter, and mostly transport maritime , well-mixed and clean sea air. The second
            maximum from the southeast and east is often characteristic of high-pressure weather conditions in
            continental air masses, which can lead to relatively hot or cold days, depending on the season.</p>
